# Summary:

This project is a Postgres implementation of the database designed in the previous phases.



*   Link to the repository: [https://github.com/dalisyron/PostgreAppStore](https://github.com/dalisyron/PostgreAppStore)


# Creators:

The queries for creating the database can be found in the <code><em>"creators/"</em></code> directory.


# Populators:

To load the sample data for testing the queries use the file in the <code><em>"populators/"</em></code> directory. (Generators generate the populators)


# GUI App (Bonus):

It’s possible to test the database with the gui app too. The app is inside the “app/” directory and can be run with the following command:


```
python3 database.py
```


psycopg2 and tkinter dependencies are needed. To run them you have to download them based on your OS. You can use brew on macOS.
